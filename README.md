CISC-361: Operating Systems: Programming Project:
Scheduling and Deadlock Avoidance

Name: Alexandra Hurst, Kalyani Khutale.
     
     
Project Goal: To design and implement a program that simulates the job scheduling and CPU
scheduling of an operating system with Deadlock avoidance by Bankers Algorithm.

Algorithm
Job Scheduling: 
1. Hold Queue 1: Shortest Job First (SJF)
2. Hold Queue 2: First in First Out (FIFO)

Process Scheduling:
Round Robin (FIFO).

Deadlock avoidance: Bankers Algorithm.
